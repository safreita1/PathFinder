# Datasets:

Pre-loaded datasets are from the Stanford SNAP collection (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html), including: DBLP, Youtube and LiveJournal.
DBLP w/ names is the DBLP dataset which uses names instead of integers to represent nodes. Name information was taken from the DBLP site (http://dblp.uni-trier.de/faq/How+can+I+download+the+whole+dblp+dataset.html) and modified for use in the PathFinder program.
